The population of India has continued to increase from the past many years and to order and discipline such a large population becomes quite difficult. Think about our traffic police officers where they need to stand on the road for the complete day to avoid chaos on road. It becomes difficult for them to fine the culprits, and the indiscipline on the roads carry on, so to avoid such problems, we have come up with the solution, where the system would be embedded in the vehicle that would help the authorities to maintain discipline on the roads by monitoring the speed of the vehicles and even helping them to fine the culprits.
